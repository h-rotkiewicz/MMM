# DC Motor Circuit Simulator

## Overview

The **DC Motor Circuit Simulator** is a graphical application that allows users to simulate and analyze the behavior of a DC motor circuit. Developed in C++, this simulator provides an interactive visual interface using **Dear ImGui**, enabling users to adjust parameters and observe real-time changes in the motor's performance.

## Features

- **Real-Time Simulation**: Observe the dynamic response of a DC motor circuit as you modify parameters such as voltage, resistance, inductance, and load.
- **Interactive GUI**: User-friendly interface built with Dear ImGui, facilitating easy manipulation of circuit elements and instant visual feedback.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students and enthusiasts to learn about electromechanical systems and the principles governing DC motors.
- **Extensive Customization**: Ability to tweak a wide range of parameters to simulate different scenarios and operating conditions.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Graphical User Interface**: [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- **Simulation Backend**: Custom physics engine implementing DC motor equations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
